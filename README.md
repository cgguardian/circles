Fitbit gallery page: https://gallery.fitbit.com/details/e93c9fee-0eb7-4e36-83d3-0f8aefd32646

Version: 1.0.7

First clockface. It's nothing too fancy.

Included:

- clock
- heart rate (dynamic; animation matches user heart rate)
- battery %
- interactable graphics for: steps, distance, floors, active zone minutes, calories burned

The stat rings fill for the first time at half opacity when you're halfway to your goal, and fill a second time at full opacity once the goal has been achieved.
Tap on the stat icons to see numeric totals, and vice versa.

If you like what you see, I would love it if you would consider buying me a coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/camerpaw
